** [1.0.0] - 2019-06-17 **

# Changed
- No changes made.

# Added
- Docstrings to main(), import_clean_process() and plot_data_matplotlib().
- Comments to main(), import_clean_process() and plot_data_matplotlib().

# Deprecated
- No deprecations to note.

# Enhancements
- Plot the same data with the Seaborn library (purely for comparison purposes).

# Removed
- The uk_tmax, uk_tmin, global_temp_upper and global_temp_lower columns from
  df_data (the dataframe with the data) as I wasn't going to need them for this
  project.

# Defects
- No defects known. 


** [0.3.0] - 2019-06-15 **

# Changed
- plot_data_matplotlib(), altered the red colour to compliment the blue.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), the title to something appropriate.

# Added
- plot_data_matplotlib(), a second shaded region to the bottom subplot to
  seperate the lack of temperature date for the UK.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), coloured y axes to match the colours of the line
  plots.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), annotations to the shaded regions of the subplots to
  explain their significance.

# Deprecated
- No deprecations to note.

# Enhancements
- plot_data_matplotlib(), plot the same data with the Seaborn library (purely
  for comparison purposes).
- Docstrings to each function.
- Include comments.

# Removed
- import_clean_process(), removed the 2019 reading for UK temperature as it
  isn't representative of the whole year.

# Defects
- No defects known.


** [0.2.0] - 2019-06-10 **

# Changed
- plot_data_matplotlib(), The references to the colurs for the data are now
  hexadecimal.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), changed the colours of the plots to what I thought
  were more appropriate appealing colours.

# Added
- plot_data_matplotlib(), a temporary title.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), a shaded area to each subplot to indicate there is no
  data available for this period.

# Deprecated
- No deprecations to note.

# Enhancements
- plot_data_matplotlib(), change the title to be more meaningful.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), annotate the plot in the shaded region.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), remove the 2019 reading for UK temperature as it
  isn't representative of the whole year.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), plot the same data with the Seaborn library (purely
  for comparison purposes).

# Removed
- No features removed.

# Defects
- plot_data_matplotlib(), fixed the legend, so it is displayed correctly.


** [0.1.0] - 2019-06-09 **

# Changed
- plot_data_matplotlib(), all scatter plots are now line plots, I felt this
  presented the patterns in the data better.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), changed the scale of the bottom subplot to match the
  top.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), set the x axis ticks to occur every 20 years, not 40.

# Added
- plot_data_matplotlib(), colours to each line plot.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), appropriate units to each y axis.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), some brief comments in the code to the styling of the
  plot.

# Deprecated
- No deprecations to note.

# Enhancements
- plot_data_matplotlib(), add a title.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), remove the 2019 reading for UK temperature as it
  isn't representative of the whole year.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), plot the same data with the Seaborn library (purely
  for comparison purposes).
- plot_data_matplotlib(), put the legend back in (the change to line plots
  requires an alterante method to display the legend froom shared x axes).

# Removed
- plot_data_matplotlib(), the seaborn style for this plot, the
  plot_data_matplotlib() function is to view the capability of matplotlib
  alone.

# Defects
- No defects known.


** [0.0.0] - 2019-05-28 **

# Changed
- First version, no changes made.

# Added
- First version, no features added.

# Deprecated
- First version, no features deprecated.

# Enhancements
- plot_data_matplotlib(), set a colour to each line.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), add a title.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), set both x axes to the same time period.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), have "CO2" displayed correctly with the "2"
  subscripted.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), add the degrees symbol to temperature axes units.
- plot_data_matplotlib(), add units to the left y axes.

# Removed
- First version, no features removed.
